# Codename-RIP
2102 Group Project
This unfinished game was created with a group of three other students as a class project while studing software engineering practices. The game is a 2D platformmer that stars a Gnome protagonist who has the ability to travel back in time. 
The game uses Java exclusively with no third party libraries. It includes one thread that runs the game engine which is a traditional game loop. The graphics were done using Gimp and Adobe Photoshop.
